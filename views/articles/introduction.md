### Introduction

Over the last decade the availability of music has increased dramatically. Gone are the days of hovering over the record button on a tape deck to record this week's hits from the radio, nowadays people can have several music libraries synced across multiple devices. Due to the increased public use of music applications the research in the music field has also increased in the last few years, not only into the applications but into how we can use machines to automate the laborious, expensive work humans would otherwise have to do. Although the techniques aren't perfect yet users are starting to see the research appear in everyday applications, iTunes has genius, Rdio has a Browse be feeling or mood section and there are countless more examples to add to the list. On this website we will go over the techniques used to allow these new features to be used by users, but more specifically how we can use machines to do our work, and not only that but actually take a small amount of data and use all of its previous efforts to make increasingly more accurate predictions.
