### what is a classification problem

  A classification problem is one in which the data is to be given some label(s) describing their nature in relation to a given situation. In the context of Music Emotion Recognition (MER) this involves giving a piece of music a label or a set of labels in describing which emotion(s) the music is trying to evoke, e.g. confident, cheerful, aggressive. See the MIREX table of 5 clusters of emotional labels[^7]. It is important to note that what the Machine Learning Algorithms want to retrieve the emotion which the piece of music is trying to evoke, rather than the perceived emotion, as listeners may respond to different pieces of music in different way, e.g. a person may be pleased to hear melancholic music if this is the tone of music they enjoy[^1]. A ground truth is the term given to a label which a certain piece of data actually has. the aim of classification techniques is to suggest a high probability (or in a perfect world 'certainty') of the data having this ground truth label. Note that many ground truths can exist for a given data piece.

### different types of classification

   In general, if a problem is labeled as a classification problem, it means that all elements in the data set should fall into one of two opposing categories, e.g. in the scenario of determining whether it is day or night in a photograph, each photo should be classified as 'day' or 'not day'.[^(8)FIND REF!!] This is clearly not the case for MER as there are so many emotional label for a piece of music to fall under. In this article, four different forms of classification will be discussed which involve a large set of candidate labels:
   - Single-label
   The single-label technique acknowledges the possibility of data belonging to many labels. However, once the algorithm finds labels which it believes the data belongs to, a single label is chosen based on some criterion, e.g. which label has highest calculated probability for this data piece[^4].
   - Multi-class
   - Multi-label
   - Fuzzy-label

## Why classification is difficult

## How ML helps (briefly)

## Use the machine learning models as paragraphs/sections
//// in each section then talk about Single/Multi label multi class and fuzzy labelling
//// provide real life studies where the methods have been used, even better if the study used machine learning
