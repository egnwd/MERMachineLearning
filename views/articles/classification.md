#General
 1. Note the subjects are asked to label the emotion
 based on their feelings of what the music sample is
 trying to evoke, rather than the emotion the subjects
 perceive at the test. We must make this distinction
 clear because perceived emotion and evoking emotion
 are not always the same. For example, a person who
 enjoys sorrowful tone might feel pleased when listening
 to sorrowful songs. Since MER is developed to help
 people retrieve music samples through a coordinate in the
 emotion plane, it is more natural and adequate that the AV
 values of a song are correspondent with the evoking emotion.

 2.  German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who said that
 “without music, life would be a mistake”

#Classification
 2. Traditional
 single-label classification is concerned with learning from
 a set of examples that are associated with a single label λ
 from a set of disjoint labels L, |L| > 1.In multilabel
 classification, the examples are associated with a set of
 labels Y ⊆ L

 3. Multilabel classification methods can be categorized into
 two different groups: i) problem transformation methods (PTMs),
  and ii) algorithm adaptation methods.
  PTMs involve turning a multi-label classification problem into
  1+ single-label classification/ regression problems
