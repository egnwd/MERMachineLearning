# Structure

### Introduction - Elliot
 - Music creates emotions
 - What is MER?
  - Sub-category of MIR study
  - Define emotion
 - Cover techniques &amp; problems
 - History of MER
  - Disclaimer: New science so not a lot of history
  - What sparked interest
#### Non-Textual Features
  - Schematic of one of the techniques (Flow diagram)

### Techniques - Florian
Machine Learning Techniques in MER
- Intro
- What is ML?
- What the process are?
- Why use ML for this process?
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- et al
- Apply techniques to Classification and regression
- Table showing who used which models in their studies
- Comparisons between the techniques
#### Non-textual features
- Flowchart of the process &times; 3
- Psuedo-code for algorithms
- Figure for comparisons

### Classification - Elyas
 - Introduction
  - Four sentences max
  - what is classification?
   - don't go too in depth, apart from what strictly ties in with machine learning
   - always room to pad it out later
  - Why classification is difficult
  - How ML helps (briefly)
 - Use the machine learning models as paragraphs/sections
  - in each section then talk about Single/Multi label multi class and fuzzy labelling
  - provide real life studies where the methods have been used, even better if the study used machine learning
 - Comparative paragraph
 - Classification difficulties
 - How ML helps
#### Non-textual features
 - Table1 comparison of Multi(class vs Label)
 - Animation1 (think about one)
 - Table2 emotional adjectives

### Regression - Nana
 - Intro
  - Four sentences max
  - What is regression?
  - Why regression is difficult
  - How ML Helps (briefly)
 - Description of V-A
  - History
  - How generated
  - How to read it (Fig1 here?)
 - As with classification use the ML models to break this into sections not the regression methods
   - Non-time based regression
   - Time based regression
    - pros and cons table?
    - point & moving point (if these are things)
    - area & moving area
 - Always remember to talk about the studies you find online, as well as the articles given to us, and try to relate them to what you a talking about at the time
 - Regression vs Classification (pros & cons) table?
#### Non-textual features
 - Figure1 V-A vector space


### Summary - Elliot

  - Discuss the conclusions of all of the comparisons
  - Final statements
  - Potential Machine learning techniques that haven't been used a great deal to solve problems
